//JAVASCRIPT -> scripting language in the browser... got popular
//NODe.js -> a runtime to execute js outside out of the browser ie) a web server, an app on computer

//Js -> client,   Node -> server

//JS ... is messy, and too flexible .. 

//So.. created people created libraries to make JS dev easier..
//Made React / Angular /  ... for JS....

// what Next.js is .. a framework ontop React... to allow Server Side Rendering

// use NEXT instead of create-react-app (no server side rendering)
